# FF-PDF2TXT

This is a simple server that extracts text from a PDF using [Apache PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org/).  You can see it in action by looking at the [form at FileFormat.Info](http://www.fileformat.info/convert/doc/pdf2txt.htm).

The code is deliberately simple to avoid dependencies.  All necessary libraries are included.
